/**
 * The MockCommand class is the base class for all commands
 * that the client may send to the mock to instruct it to
 * do certain actions.
 * <p/>
 * All commands is sent as JSON objects with a certain form:
 * <p/>
 * { "command" : "name of the command", "payload" : {  } }
 * <p/>
 * The response for the command will be delivered at its most basic
 * level will be a JSON object consisting of the following fields:
 * <p/>
 * { "status" : "ok", "payload" : { } }
 * <p/>
 * For "non-successful" commands the object may be:
 * <p/>
 * { "status" : "fail", "error" : "error description" }
 * <p/>
 * To implement a new command you should subclass the MockCommand
 * class and add implement the execute method. You must add the
 * name of the command to the Command enum, and register the
 * class in MockCommandDispatcher.
