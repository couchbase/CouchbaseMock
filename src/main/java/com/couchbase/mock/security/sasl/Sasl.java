     * Creates a new {@link SaslServer} and first tries the JVM built-in servers
     * before falling back to {@link ShaSaslServer} implementations. The mechanisms are tried
     * in the order they arrive.
     *
     * @param mechanism  The non-null mechanism name. It must be an IANA-registered
     *                   name of a SASL mechanism. (e.g. "SCRAM-SHA512", "PLAIN").
     * @param serverName The fully qualified host name of the server, or null if the
     *                   server is not bound to any specific host name. If the mechanism does
     *                   not allow an unbound server, a SaslException will be thrown.
     * @param props      The possibly null set of properties used to select the SASL
     *                   mechanism and to configure the authentication exchange of the selected
     *                   mechanism. For example, if props contains the Sasl.POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT
     *                   property with the value "true", then the selected SASL mechanism must
     *                   not be susceptible to simple plain passive attacks. In addition to the
     *                   standard properties declared in this class, other, possibly
     *                   mechanism-specific, properties can be included. Properties not
     *                   relevant to the selected mechanism are ignored, including any map
     *                   entries with non-String keys.
     * @param cbh        The possibly null callback handler to used by the SASL mechanisms
     *                   to get further information from the application/library to complete
     *                   the authentication. For example, a SASL mechanism might require the
     *                   authentication ID, password and realm from the caller. The
     *                   authentication ID is requested by using a NameCallback. The password
     *                   is requested by using a PasswordCallback. The realm is requested by
     *                   using a RealmChoiceCallback if there is a list of realms to choose
     *                   from, and by using a RealmCallback if the realm must be entered.
     * @return A possibly null SaslServer created using the parameters supplied. If
     * null, cannot find a SaslServerFactory that will produce one.
     * @throws SaslException If cannot create a SaslServer because of an error.
