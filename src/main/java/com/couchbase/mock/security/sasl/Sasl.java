     * Creates a new {@link SaslServer} and first tries the JVM built-in servers
     * before falling back to {@link ShaSaslServer} implementations. The mechanisms are tried
     * in the order they arrive.
     * 
     * @param mechanism The non-null mechanism name. It must be an IANA-registered
     *        name of a SASL mechanism. (e.g. "SCRAM-SHA512", "PLAIN").
     * @param protocol The non-null string name of the protocol for which the
     *        authentication is being performed (e.g., "couchbase").
     * @param serverName The fully qualified host name of the server, or null if the
     *        server is not bound to any specific host name. If the mechanism does
     *        not allow an unbound server, a SaslException will be thrown.
     * @param props The possibly null set of properties used to select the SASL
     *        mechanism and to configure the authentication exchange of the selected
     *        mechanism. For example, if props contains the Sasl.POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT
     *        property with the value "true", then the selected SASL mechanism must
     *        not be susceptible to simple plain passive attacks. In addition to the
     *        standard properties declared in this class, other, possibly
     *        mechanism-specific, properties can be included. Properties not
     *        relevant to the selected mechanism are ignored, including any map
     *        entries with non-String keys.
     * @param cbh The possibly null callback handler to used by the SASL mechanisms
     *        to get further information from the application/library to complete
     *        the authentication. For example, a SASL mechanism might require the
     *        authentication ID, password and realm from the caller. The
     *        authentication ID is requested by using a NameCallback. The password
     *        is requested by using a PasswordCallback. The realm is requested by
     *        using a RealmChoiceCallback if there is a list of realms to choose
     *        from, and by using a RealmCallback if the realm must be entered.
     * @return A possibly null SaslServer created using the parameters supplied. If
     *         null, cannot find a SaslServerFactory that will produce one.
     * @throws SaslException If cannot create a SaslServer because of an error.
